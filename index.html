 <h2>Nathan Beecher</h2>
 <p>My name is Nathan Beecher, a master procrastinator third year student with a major in Computer Science.  Im 20 and like coding, music and games and online school is the antithesis
    of my entire being. When i was asked to write a paragraph about myself i genuinely debated having a normal introduction then the bee movie script but that was 3400 lines and 
    probably wouldnt make the best webpage so here we are.  This course seems very interesting and i hope that Info2180 can be a good learning experience for me.
